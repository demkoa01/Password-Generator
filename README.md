# Password Generator Starter Code

## The Password Generator creates a random password determined by a users critera

### User has to determine length and must choose at least one type of special character (2-5):
#### 1. Length, either between 1-8 characters or between 8-128 characters
#### 2. Usage of special characters "!@#$%^&*()"
#### 3. Usage of numbers "0123456789"
#### 4. Usage of lower case letters "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
#### 5. Usage of upper case letters "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"

### After Criteria is determined a length & a string of possible characters is created

### From there, a function creates and outputs a random password as an alert & in the text box of the page
